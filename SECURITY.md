## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please use the Private Vulnerability Reporting feature on GitHub:

- Navigate to the Security tab of this repository.
- Select "Vulnerability reporting" from the left-hand sidebar.
- Click "Report a vulnerability" to open a private advisory.

Include as much detail as possible:

- Steps to reproduce.
- Potential impact.

This allows us to collaborate with you on a fix in a private workspace before the issue is made public.
